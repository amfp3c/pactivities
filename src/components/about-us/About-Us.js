            <h2>Our Motto</h2>
            <p>There is a growing interest in enabling communities to cooperate among themselves to solve problems in times of crisis, 
                whether it be to advertise where supplies are held, offer assistance for collections, or other local services like 
                volunteer deliveries.</p>
            <p>For example, with the COVID-19 crisis, federal and local governments may be rolling out broad programs, but cooperation at 
                the local level is usually the most effective way of getting help to where it is most needed as quickly as possible.  
                Traditional social media is one way of communicating within a community, but this is often not sufficiently structured to  
                enable rapid discovery of help needed.</p>
            <p>In the current crisis, we have already seen shortages of local food, medical equipment, and other supplies. In addition, the 
                recommended (or required) self-isolation and social distancing measures can compound the problem by preventing people from 
                easily getting to locations with the best stocks of supplies.</p>
            <p>What is needed is a solution that empowers communities to easily connect and provide this information to each other.</p>
